# 24 Hour NFT Minter

Each Episode of the AlphaGrowth.Fun podcast features prominent Crypto Artists from ùïè.

This Contract allows an Open Edition Mint with a time limit of 24 Hours.
NFTs are stored on Arweave, and TokenURI is updated on the Frontend through the MINT button.

The podcast interviews multiple ecosystems, so to maintain flexibility, a new NFT contract will be deployed for each episode.

100% of sales go to support the artist for that episode, and that 0xAddress is coded into the contract.
